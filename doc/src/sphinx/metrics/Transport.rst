Netty Transporter
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

**connect_latency_ms**
  A histogram of the length of time it takes for a socket connection (including SSL/TLS handshake)
  to succeed, in milliseconds.

**failed_connect_latency_ms**
  A histogram of the length of time it takes for a socket connection (including SSL/TLS handshake)
  to fail, in milliseconds.

**cancelled_connects**
  A counter of the number of attempts to connect that were cancelled before
  they succeeded.

ServerBridge
<<<<<<<<<<<<

**read_timeout**
  A counter of the number of times the netty channel has caught a
  ``ReadTimeoutException`` while reading.

**write_timeout**
  A counter of the number of times the netty channel has caught a
  ``WriteTimeoutException`` while writing.

ChannelRequestStatsHandler
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

**connection_requests** `verbosity:debug`
  A histogram of the number of requests received over the lifetime of a
  connection.

ChannelStatsHandler
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

**connects**
  A counter of the total number of successful connections made.

**closes**
  A counter of the total number of channel close operations initiated. To see the
  total number of closes completed, use the total count from one of the
  "connection_duration", "connection_received_bytes", or "connection_sent_bytes"
  histograms.

**connection_duration** `verbosity:debug`
  A histogram of the duration of the lifetime of a connection, in milliseconds.

**connection_received_bytes** `verbosity:debug`
  A histogram of the number of bytes received over the lifetime of a connection.

**connection_sent_bytes** `verbosity:debug`
  A histogram of the number of bytes sent over the lifetime of a connection.

**received_bytes**
  A counter of the total number of received bytes.

**sent_bytes**
  A counter of the total number of sent bytes.

**tcp_retransmits** `verbosity:debug`
  A counter of the number of TCP retransmits that have occurred.

**tcp_send_window_size** `verbosity:debug`
  A histogram of the TCP send window size (in bytes) per channel.

**writableDuration** `verbosity:debug`
  A gauge of the length of time the socket has been writable in the channel.

**unwritableDuration** `verbosity:debug`
  A gauge of the length of time the socket has been unwritable in the channel.

**connections**
  A gauge of the total number of connections that are currently open in the
  channel.

**pending_io_events**
  A gauge of the number of pending IO events enqueued in all event loops servicing
  this client or server. If this metric climbs up, it indicates an overload scenario
  when IO threads are not being able to process the scheduled work (handling new
  requests and new connections). A very typical cause of these symptoms is either
  blocking or running a CPU intensive workloads on IO threads.

**exn/<exception_name>+**
  A counter of the number of times a specific exception has been thrown within
  a Netty pipeline.

**tls/connections**
  A gauge of the total number of SSL/TLS connections that are currently open in
  the channel.

**tls/snooped_connects**
  A counter of the number of TLS connections that were detected via snooping.

IdleChannelHandler
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

**disconnects/{READER_IDLE,WRITER_IDLE}**
  A counter of the number of times a connection was disconnected because of a
  given idle state.

SSL/TLS
<<<<<<<

**handshake_latency_ms**
   A histogram of the SSL/TLS handshake latency in milliseconds.

**failed_handshake_latency_ms** `verbosity:debug`
   A histogram of the failed SSL/TLS handshake latency in milliseconds.
