 * Finagle provides the following backoff strategies:
 *
 *   1. BackoffFunction
 *     - Create backoffs based on a given function, can be created via `Backoff.apply`.
 *   1. BackoffFromGeneration
 *     - Create backoffs based on a generation function, can be created via `Backoff.fromFunction`.
 *   1. Const
 *     - Return a constant backoff, can be created via `Backoff.const`.
 *   1. Exponential
 *     - Create backoffs that grow exponentially, can be created via `Backoff.exponential`.
 *   1. Linear
 *     - Create backoffs that grow linearly, can be created via `Backoff.linear`.
 *   1. DecorrelatedJittered
 *     - Create backoffs that jitter randomly between a start value and 3 times of that value, can be created via `Backoff.decorrelatedJittered`.
 *   1. EqualJittered
 *     - Create backoffs that jitter between 0 and half of the exponential growth. Can be created via `Backoff.equalJittered`.
 *   1. ExponentialJittered
 *     - Create backoffs that jitter randomly between 0 and a value that grows exponentially by 2. Can be created via `Backoff.exponentialJittered`.
 *
 * @note A new [[Backoff]] will be created only when `next` is called.
 * @note None of the [[Backoff]]s are memoized, for strategies that involve
 *       randomness (`DecorrelatedJittered`, `EqualJittered` and
 *       `ExponentialJittered`), there is no way to foresee the next backoff
 *       value.
 * @note All [[Backoff]]s are infinite unless using [[take(Int)]] to create a
 *       strategy with limited number of iterations.
 * @note You can combine one or more [[Backoff]]s with [[take(Int)]] and
