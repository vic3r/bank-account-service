/**
 * Stack params for configuring TLS snooping
 *
 * TLS snooping is a server side feature which allows servers to use both cleartext
 * and TLS socket connections on the same port. This should only be used if it is
 * desirable but not required that traffic be encrypted.
 *
 * There are two classes of protocols considered: protocols that support TLS
 * negotiation such as Mux and those that don't such as the framed thrift transport.
 * The two classes of protocols have a different truth matrix for determining
 * whether to enable TLS negotiation (see below). For example, a negotiating TLS
 * connection that _requires_ TLS may enable snooping because if the connection
 * starts cleartext the session itself may upgrade to a secure connection later.
 * In contrast, a cleartext HTTP connection has no way to upgrade to a secure
 * connection and thus if TLS is required snooping must be disabled.
