/**
 * `SslSessionInfo` provides information related to an existing connection's use
 * of an SSL/TLS session. SSL/TLS sessions are either negotiated or resumed
 * during handshaking. When using SSL/TLS, one and only one SSL/TLS session is
 * associated with a connection, although it's possible that an SSL/TLS session
 * may be reused between multiple connections.
 *
 * An instance of this class should be associated with an existing connection.
 * When using SSL/TLS, the instance provides easy access to the session and its
 * relevant information. When not using SSL/TLS (i.e. there is no existing
 * SSL/TLS session), then a `NullSslSessionInfo` should be used instead.
