/**
 * Allow us to inject annotations into children trace contexts. Example, with dark
 * traffic or retries we want to be able to tag the produced spans from each call
 * (the light/dark calls, or each individual retry) with information that allows us
 * to tie them together as a single logical item: a light request paired with a dark
 * request, or an initial request and a series of retries. The problem lies in the fact
 * that at the time we have the information about the relationship, the
 * child trace context doesn't actually yet exist. In order to trace where it is needed, we need
 * to have a hook into the trace context of these children requests which don't yet exist.
 * We do this by placing annotations we want each child trace context to carry inside the local
 * context and accessing them when the child trace context is realized through a stack module. The
 * stack module will place a filter in the correct trace context, after the Trace Initialization
 * Filter, which allows us to record the annotations in the proper place.
